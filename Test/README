Running Tests
=============

 * Start TestServer
   $ Test/TestServer $
 * Run the test suite in Test/ directory
   $ cd Test
   $ wstest -m fuzzingclient
 * Shutdown the TestServer after the test suite finishes its execution
   $ kill `ps -eo pid,comm | grep TestServer | awk '{ print $1 }'`

Check the Test/reports/server/index.html for the test suite report.

By default performance tests are skipped, if you want to run them,
empty the "exclude-cases" configuration option in fuzzingclient.json file.

For other configuration options refer to AutobahnTestSuite documentation.
